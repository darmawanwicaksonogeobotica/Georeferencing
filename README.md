# Georeferencing Script

This repository contains a script and methodology for performing automatic georeferencing of point cloud data using various filtering and transformation techniques.

## Introduction
The georeferencing process involves identifying and aligning point cloud data with a defined coordinate system. This project incorporates advanced clustering and transformation techniques, ensuring accurate georeferencing by utilizing centroid calculation, distance measurement, and angle verification for identifying prisms.

## Features
- Processing and filtering LAS files.
- DBSCAN clustering to identify point cloud patterns.
- Multi-stage filtering for identifying prisms based on:
  - Distance
  - Tolerance thresholds
  - Angular deviations
- Rigid transformation for aligning point clouds.
- Comprehensive transformation matrix application to the entire dataset.

## Dependencies
To use the scripts, install the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `laspy`
- `matplotlib`


## Workflows
-Read the LAS File: Load the point cloud data from a .las file.
-Unit Conversion: Ensure consistent units for further processing.
-Clustering with DBSCAN: Identify clusters with specific intensity values.
-Centroid and Distance Calculation: Calculate centroids and compare distances with actual prism data.
-Multi-Stage Filtering:
-Distance-based filtering with different tolerances.
-Angle-based filtering to eliminate "fake" prisms.
-Rigid Transformation: Perform georeferencing using transformation matrices.
-Apply Transformation: Transform the entire point cloud data using the derived transformation matrix.
